# GettingBetter

## GettingBetter is a microsystem-based framework for improving your life.

#### Principles

- Modularity is key.
- The smaller a task, the more likely you are to do it.
- It is better (and easier) to fill up your life with good things than cleanse it of bad things.

#### Behind the Name

The name is inspired by the [Beatles song "Getting Better"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGlo9LzmOME), in which Paul McCartney sings:

> It's getting better all the time
>
> I admit it's getting better (Better)
>
> A little better all the time (It can't get no worse)
>
> Yes I admit it's getting better (Better)
> 
> Getting so much better all the time

By getting a little better all the time, we can build compound interest on incremental improvement. The goal of this framework is to empower anyone to build this compound interest, and reach their goals in the process.

Incremental improvement is powerful, and all great successes have been built incrementally, in one form or another. Don't be afraid of starting small â€” if you do, you will have already taken a step that most won't:

> Asked how it could be that God often showed himself to people in the olden days while nowadays nobody ever sees him, the rabbi replied: "Nowadays there is now longer anybody who can bow low enough." ~ Carl Jung, *Man and His Symbols*

### Getting Started 

As of now, GettingBetter exists only as a blog post guide (available here), and a loose schema definition (available here). Ultimately, the goal is to develop it into a simple web-app that anyone can use to generate and keep track of their microsystems.
