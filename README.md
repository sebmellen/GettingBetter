# GettingBetter

## GettingBetter is a framework for getting better by adopting a microsystem approach to life

### Principles

- Modularity is key.
- The smaller a task, the more likely you are to do it.
- It is better (and easier) to fill up your life with good things than cleanse it of bad things.
