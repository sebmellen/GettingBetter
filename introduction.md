# Introduction

At its core, GettingBetter is very simple. The framework is made up of three blocks of syntax:

1. **Tasks**, which make up
2. **Routines**, which make up
3. **Systems**.

## Tasks

Tasks are quite self explanatory. They are quantifiable, small pieces of work that like brushing one's teeth or

piece of work assigned or done as part of one's duties.

## Systems

There are three basic types of systems:

- Exploratory systems,
- Maintenance systems, and
- Goal-oriented systems.

### Exploratory and Maintenance Systems

A system does not require a clearly stated goal or objective. For example, you could create a system for learning origami or meditation, and explore these activities for their own sake. These systems would then both be _exploratory systems_. Also, there are many necessary daily activities which are (usually) performed without any goal in mind, like sleeping and eating. You use systems to improve the quality of these activities, or simply to create functioning routines around them. These systems

the problem with our modern politics is that the majority has convinced itself they are the dissenters, on all sides.
“Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it’s time to pause and reflect.”

-Mark Twain

### Goal-Oriented Systems

You probably want to achieve something, so you probably have goals. If you're serious about reaching your goals, you may have tried (or may be doing) some of the following:

#### Goal Setting

- Setting goals using
  - SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-Driven)
  - HARD (Heartfelt, Animated, Required, Difficult), or
  - BHAG (Big, Hairy, Audacious Goal) techniques.

#### Esoteric Approaches

- Dopamine fasting
- Visualization techniques
- Triggering a flow state by listening to binaural beats
- Meditation/mindfulness techniques
- Dopamine fasting
- Create A Vision Board

#### Business Management

- Make A Public Commitment
- Time management/scheduling
- Using accountability charts
- Daily planners
- Task automation
- Outsourcing
- Working in public spaces like cafes or libraries

#### Self-Reflection

- Working with a life coach
- Going to counseling or therapy
- Conducting Self-Authoring exercises
- Writing a journal

#### Motivation

- Reading motivational articles
- Reading organization and time management books/articles
- Reading Stoic texts and adopting a Stoic philosophy

#### Productivity Apps

- Gamifying your life using apps like Habitica
- Creating to-do lists with apps like Todoist, Evernote, or OneNote
- Creating Kanban boards for task management using apps like Trello, Asana, or Notion
- Blocking distracting websites or apps
- Using other productivity apps

#### Methods and Techniques

- Using the Pomodoro technique
- Using the Flowtime technique
- Using the Autofocus productivity method
- Using the Zen to Done method
- Adopting extreme ownership (ala Jocko Willink)

**GettingBetter rejects these approaches in favor of a simple, pragmatic alternative.**

- Schedules are a hassle at best, counterproductive at worst
- Accountability is a distraction
- Goals are usually worthless

The idea for this project came to me from a psychedelic revelation about the power of attention. Human attention is akin to a strong light, or laser, and most of us split our attention up into thousands of little beams which are unable to actually "burn up" the tasks we focus on. If we can turn our attention into a strong laser beam, from a split up mess, we can knock tasks out quickly, one at a time, and move on to the next. If we have the full power of our attention available, most of the concepts we use to "manage our productivity" become secondary and unimportant, because as long as we are doing something, it doesn't matter what we're doing. 

You want to be in "zombie mode" for the things you do every day.
